										<h2 class="mb-5">kVA Process Transformers Pvt. Ltd.: <br> Leading Transformer Manufacturer in India</h2>
										<img src="/images/home/About-us-image.jpg" alt="">
										<p class="mt-5">kVA Process Transformers Pvt. Ltd. is a leading transformer manufacturing company in India, specializing in high-efficiency and low-loss transformers. We offer a diverse range of transformers tailored to meet various industrial needs.</p>
										<h2 class="title">Types of Transformers We Offer:</h2>
										<p><strong>Dry Type Transformers:</strong> Utilizing class "C" insulation and vacuum impregnation, these transformers operate at temperatures up to 140Â°C. They are ideal for strict environmental conditions and are non-flammable, ensuring safety from fire or explosion hazards. These transformers are suitable for installation near load centers, reducing cabling costs and improving voltage regulation.</p>
										<p><strong>Auto Transformers:</strong> Featuring a single winding on a laminated core, auto transformers function as voltage regulators. They are available in two types:
										<ol style="list-style: circle;">
											<li><strong>Type 1:</strong> Continuous winding with a tap at the desired secondary voltage.</li>
											<li><strong>Type 2:</strong> Continuous winding formed by electrically connecting two or more distinct coils.</li>
										</ol></p>
										<p><strong>Earthing Transformers:</strong> These transformers provide a ground path to ungrounded wye or delta-connected systems, ensuring safety and stability in power systems. They are classified as standard reactors and can supply local auxiliary loads.</p>

										<p><strong>Submerged Arc Furnace Transformers:</strong> Designed for high-demand applications like phosphorus production and ferroalloy manufacturing, these transformers are built to withstand rigorous conditions and fluctuations in currents and voltages. They are known for their robust design and long life.</p>

										<p><strong>Distribution Transformers:</strong> We offer a wide range of oil-filled distribution transformers with on-load and off-load tap changers, up to 5000 kVA in 6 kV, 11 kV, 22 kV, and 33 kV voltage classes. These transformers are designed using the latest technologies and can be provided with various terminal configurations.</p>

										<p><strong>Oil Cooled Transformers:</strong> These transformers use insulating oil for cooling, dissipating heat through natural circulation. They are suitable for various industrial applications requiring efficient heat management.</p>

										<p><strong>Power Transformers:</strong> Designed for high-performance applications, our power transformers are available up to 50,000 kVA and can operate at voltages up to 132 kV. They are tailored to meet specific customer requirements, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.</p>

										<p><strong>On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) Transformers:</strong> These transformers feature an on-load tap changer mechanism, allowing voltage regulation without interrupting the power supply. They are available in various configurations to suit different industrial needs.</p>

										<p><strong>Induction Melting Furnace Transformers:</strong> Designed for induction furnaces, these transformers are essential for converting available three-phase AC voltage to the required DC voltage for the inverter circuit. They are built to withstand frequent short circuits and are available in 6, 12, 18, and 24 pulse systems</p>
