								Ladle Refining Arc Furnace (LRF) Transformers are essential in the steel industry, facilitating the ladle refining process in AC furnaces. They ensure stability during arcing between electrodes and molten steel, contributing to high-quality steel production.</p>
							<!-- <p>
								Earthing transformers are an essential part of electrical power systems. As a standard
								reactor, they provide a neutral connection to the power system, allowing for safe and
								efficient distribution of electricity. Earthing transformers also help protect against
								faults in the system, ensuring reliable electricity supply. Moreover, the earthing
								transformers could power a nearby auxiliary load.</p>
							<p>
								The zigzag transformer is a unique and advanced technology that offers a reliable,
								cost-effective solution to earthing requirements. It combines two phases offset by 120°
								in a zigzag or interconnected star winding connection, resulting in efficient power
								distribution and improved safety. This type of transformer is suitable for industrial
								and commercial applications, providing enhanced earthing protection while reducing power
								losses.</p>
							<p>Earthing transformers are essential components in an electrical network, creating a
								neutral point and enabling the safe operation of the system. The most common connection
								type used is ZN, which provides both linear and specified zero sequence impedance.
								Alternatively, YN+d connections can also be applied to achieve the desired effect. Both
								solutions provide effective earthing for any given network.</p> -->
